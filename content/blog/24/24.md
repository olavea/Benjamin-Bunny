![Benjamin Bunny and Peter Rabbit](./48.jpg)

###At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.

###The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.

###He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.

###He was looking for his son.
