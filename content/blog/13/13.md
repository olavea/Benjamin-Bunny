###Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.

###They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.

###Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.
